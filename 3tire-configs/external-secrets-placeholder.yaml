# External Secrets Operator Placeholder
#
# This file serves as a placeholder to indicate that secrets are managed
# by External Secrets Operator, not by hardcoded values in Git.
#
# The actual SecretStore and ExternalSecret resources are created by Terraform
# in the dev/external-secrets.tf file, which dynamically references:
# - Key Vault name from Terraform output
# - User Assigned Identity ID from AKS cluster
# - Tenant ID from Azure client config
#
# This approach ensures:
# ✅ No sensitive values stored in Git
# ✅ Dynamic configuration based on actual infrastructure
# ✅ Terraform manages the complete lifecycle
#
# To see the actual External Secrets configuration, check:
# - dev/external-secrets.tf (Terraform resources)
# - kubectl get secretstore -n 3tirewebapp-dev (runtime SecretStore)
# - kubectl get externalsecret -n 3tirewebapp-dev (runtime ExternalSecret)
